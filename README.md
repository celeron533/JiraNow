# JiraNow
This is a tiny tool to accelerate some of my daily work with Jira Software.<br>
Uses Jira REST API v3.<br>
Based on Winform and only for Windows(R) right now.

## Note
Code is in "just can use" state. No warranty.

âš  The API may need more details to work now (since 2023-09), such as HTTP ref or other headers rather than the cookies.

## Features
1. Read an Jira Issue with its 1st generation childs.
2. Copy child Issues to another Jira Issue.
